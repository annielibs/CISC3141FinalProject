Overseeing front end: Elian <br>
Assistting with back end: Andrew <br>
<br>

**To Do:** <br>
- [ ] Andrew suggested writing a seed script which can allow us all to populate with the same dummy data. Shouldnt be a problem to have our own separate data. For when we present, matters how the data will show up.  

- [ ] Gilman, next step is to find a hosting service so we can all have the same data. Should finalize a service before next time we meet. 

- [ ] Elian, talked with Andrew last week and they will connect the back-end and front-end. Will push to github the front end today too. Besides the home page and entry page, there's not a lot of other stuff to do front end wise. 

- [ ] Also discussed if we not doing user logins. So far we are not sure/depends on how much time we have left. Otherwise, the backend should be finished soon.

- [ ] Briefly discussed how to do controls in order to keep it consistant, decided to keep it the way we started it, for the sake of consistency.
